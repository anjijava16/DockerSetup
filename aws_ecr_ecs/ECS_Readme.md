What Is AWS ECS?
----------------------------------------------------------------
1. Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a container orchestration service that runs and manages Docker containers. 
It runs clusters of virtual machines on the Amazon cloud, while managing, scaling, and scheduling groups of containers on those machines across
multiple Availability Zones (AZs).ECS provides a convenient programmatic way to check and modify the state of your cluster, perform operations on containers, and 
directly access Amazon services related to your cluster, such as IAM, CloudWatch and CloudTrail.

Amazon ECS
-----------------------------------------------------------------
1. Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a highly scalable, high performance container orchestration service that supports Docker containers and allows you to easily run
and scale containerized applications on AWS. ECS is built to perform at scale, offers high availability and security, and is deeply integrated with a variety of AWS services, 
including Elastic Load Balancing, Amazon VPC, AWS IAM, and more. Additionally, Amazon ECS features AWS Fargate, so you can deploy containers without provisioning servers,
ultimately reducing management overhead.
2. There can be arguments made in favor of ECS over EKS in that it is simpler to use, provides heightened security due to its  integration with IAM, and is more cost-effective. But before we delve into this further, letâ€™s briefly review Amazon EKS.

Amazon EKS
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Amazon Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes (Amazon EKS) makes it easy to deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications using Kubernetes on AWS.
Since this service leverages the open-source tool Kubernetes, all applications managed by Amazon EKS are fully compatible with applications managed by any 
standard Kubernetes environment. In that sense, it can be argued that Amazon EKS is more versatile than Amazon ECS.
